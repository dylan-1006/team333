# Bridging Communication, One Sign at a Time  

## **Inspiration**  
Communication is a fundamental human right, yet millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals face barriers in their daily interactions. We wanted to create a solution that fosters inclusivity by leveraging technology to bridge this communication gap. Inspired by the power of **AI and machine learning**, we set out to develop **SignSpeak**—a real-time sign language translation web tool that enables seamless communication for all.  

## **What We Learned**  
Throughout this project, we gained valuable insights into:  
- **Machine Learning & TensorFlow** – Understanding how to train and deploy models for real-time sign language recognition.  
- **Computer Vision** – Processing and interpreting hand gestures with accuracy.  
- **Web Development with React** – Building a responsive and intuitive user interface.  
- **The Importance of Accessibility** – Designing with inclusivity in mind, ensuring our tool is user-friendly for diverse communities.  

## **How We Built It**  
Our project was developed using:  
- **React** – For the front-end interface.  
- **TensorFlow.js** – To run machine learning models directly in the browser.  
- **WebCam API** – For real-time hand gesture recognition.  
- **Custom Trained AI Model** – Using sign language datasets to improve recognition accuracy.
- **GitHub** – For version control and team collaboration.

## **Challenges We Faced**  
- **Model Accuracy & Training Data** – Finding high-quality datasets for training was a hurdle, and ensuring accurate gesture recognition required multiple iterations.  
- **Performance Optimization** – Running AI models in the browser efficiently without latency was a challenge we tackled through model optimization.  
- **User Experience & Accessibility** – Designing an intuitive UI that serves both sign language users and those unfamiliar with it required continuous testing and refinement.  
- **Keras to TensorFlow.js Conversion** – We initially trained our model in **Keras**, but converting it to **TensorFlow.js** for in-browser execution proved to be difficult due to compatibility issues and model size constraints.  

## **Conclusion**  
SignSpeak was built with a vision to **empower communication and inclusivity** through technology. While we've made significant progress, there's still room for improvement—such as expanding sign language support and enhancing model accuracy. We hope to continue refining our project and making a meaningful impact on how people connect, one sign at a time.
